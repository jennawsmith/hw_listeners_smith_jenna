## Resources

I attempted to use many resources, none of which were successful in being any help. So, I only used the class notes and lecture to help with this assignment.

## Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments

This was extremely difficult, frustrating and a few other emotions. I do NOT like Javascript very much right now! I had a lot of trouble on this, but finally got everything to work.
