            <p >Hi! I'm Mrs. Smith. I am married and have 2 huskies - no kids yet! I graduated from UCF with my bachelors in 2014 and am working on my masters from UF and will graduate in December. I have a passion for growing and challenging my students and myself. My favorites include pizza, blue, mancala, One Tree Hill, and bowling! </p>

            <h2 class="h2"> What We'll Learn This Year </h2>
            <p> There is so much fun to have in 4th grade, but we'll also be learning a LOT! In Math, we'll begin with place value up to the millions and do some adding, subtracting, rounding and investigating the meaning behind place value. Then, we'll work our way into long multiplcation and long division - solving word problems, too! The topic we'll spend the longest amount of time on is FRACTIONS! We'll talk about equivalent fractions as well as comparing, ordering, adding, subtracting and multiplying fractions (within limits). This will lead us into decimals - what they mean and comparing them too! We'll spend some time on measurement conversions and then end the year with geometry - lines, points, shapes (specifically circles) and angles! Like I said, there's a lot to learn, but it will be so fun! </p>
