            <p>Hi! I'm Mrs. Smith. I am married and have 2 huskies - no kids yet! I graduated from UCF with my bachelors in 2014 and am working on my masters from UF and will graduate in December. I have a passion for growing and challenging my students and myself. My favorites include pizza, blue, mancala, One Tree Hill, and bowling!
